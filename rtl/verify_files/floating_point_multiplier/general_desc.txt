Floating Point Multiplier

Follows the IEEE 754 specification (almost) but has been parameterized
so that you can adjust how many exponent bits and fraction bits
you want.

The exception is subnormal values are approximated to zero. In particular,
the multiplier can accept subnormal values, but it will treat it as a 0
(the fractional bits will be set to 0). The reasoning is that
the cost in hardware isn't worth the 'gradual' descent into subnormal,
if even smaller values are required, use more exponent bits. Adding
a single exponent bit expands the range by 2^2^x.
The total number of bits including the sign bit is
1 + EXP_WIDTH + FRAC_WIDTH.

By doing so, this guarantees that all multiplied numbers produce
either a 1 bit in the carry or lead position (or both), or just 0, which
means we don't need to have expensive hardware to barrel shift
to the correct exponenet.

If the exponent of the intermediary value of the multiplication just so 
happens to 0 but the carry bit is 1, then in reality, shifting it will cause
it to become a normal value again. This is not what the multiplier does,
instead it just assumes its zero and moves on. In practice, this is not a big 
issue (but admittedly can be fixed with one more pipe stage, I'm just too lazy).

The total number of bits including the sign bit is
1 + EXP_WIDTH + FRAC_WIDTH.

The total precision is 1 + FRAC_WIDTH due to the leading bit being
1 (also called hidden bit).

The bias for the exponent is 2^(EXP_WIDTH - 1) - 1

Zero or subnormal is represented when the exponent == 0. This means
that the leading bit becomes 0.

Infinity or NaN is represented when the exponent == 2^(EXP_WIDTH) - 1

This means the effective range of exponents are (unsigned --> signed)
normal:       [1, 2^(EXP_WIDTH) - 2]  --> [1 - (2^(EXP_WIDTH - 1) - 1), 2^(EXP_WIDTH - 1) - 1]
subnormal:    [0]                     --> [- 2^(EXP_WIDTH - 1)]
Infinity/NaN: [2^(EXP_WIDTH) - 1]     --> [  2^(EXP_WIDTH - 1)]

Everything is stored as unsigned, then the bias is subtracted to get the real
exponent.

'Regular form' : [sign bit | exponent bits | fractional bits]
 but to fully encapsulate information for the coming operation, I've come up with a
 
 'Total form'   : [sign bit | exponent bits | carry bit | lead bit | fractional bits | round bit ].
 We encode 3 additional bits of information, carry, lead and round bit. The order of the bits
 is most convenient. Originally I wanted to call it 'Full form' but that abbreviates as FF
 which can be confused with flip-flop.

 As for the verification forms:
 - Besides logical deductions, everytime a fundamental operator is used, the type needs to be
 studied well.
 - for example, using '<' with unsigned vs signed. This can be critical when determing bounds, 
 logic unsigned [7:0] a_reg;
 logic unsigned [7:0] x_reg;
 logic signed   [7:0] b_reg;
 logic [7:0] c_reg;
 logic [7:0] d_reg;
 ...
 something >> a_reg  // well defined as a_reg is always a positive value
 ...
 something0 >> b_reg // ambiguous, what is a negative right shift? Down to interpretation of tool.
 ...
 if(a_reg > x_reg) // well defined, again both are unsigned values.
 ...
 if(c_reg > 5)     // chances are, you mean c_reg to be treated as unsigned, but since
                  this isn't explicity declared, it's very possible for it to be treated as signed
                  (especially considering that '5' is an integer)
 if(c_reg > d_reg) // same issue as above

 - the signed and unsignedness for addition doesn't matter as it is the same operation
 - the signed and unsignedness for multiplication matters
 - bit width of resulting calculation for addition is +1 of largest
    - but we don't need to adhere to this (if you know what you are doing)
 - bit width of resulting multiplication is the addition of the bit widths
    - this needs to be strictly adhered to because there is ambiguity as to what to
      do if there isn't enough bits.
