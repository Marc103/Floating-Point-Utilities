Convert to signed

Specification:
- given fp_a_i and fp_b_i in total form, using the sign bits, convert
  the frac exp of each to its signed version if the sign bits differ, 
  in prepartion for the addition step

Descriptions:
- frac ex (expand) describes carry bit, lead bit, frac bits and round bit
  in that order.
- it's just a way to break up the full form into pieces:
    {sign bit, exp bits, frac ex bits} for ease of use

Parameters:
- EXP_WIDTH,  width of exponent part                                    
- FRAC_WIDTH, width of fractional part                                  

'Local' Parameters:
- FRAC_EX_WIDTH, width of frac ex                       
    -> 1 + 1 + FRAC_WIDTH + 1                                           _*_ _*_           
- FRAC_EX_IDX_LSB, lsb index of frac ex 
    -> 0                                                                _*_ _*_
- FRAC_EX_IDX_MSB, msb index of frac ex
    -> FRAC_EX_WIDTH + FRAC_EX_IDX_LSB - 1                              _*_ _*_
- EXP_IDX_LSB, lsb index of exp ex
    -> FRAC_EX_WIDTH                                                    _*_ _*_                                          
- EXP_IDX_MSB, msb index of exp ex
    -> EXP_WIDTH + EXP_IDX_LSB - 1                                      _*_ _*_
- SIGN_IDX, index of sign bit
    -> EXP_WIDTH + FRAC_EX_WIDTH                                        _*_ _*_
- FP_WIDTH_TOT, width of total form fp
    -> 1 + EXP_WIDTH + FRAC_EX_WIDTH                                    _*_ _*_

IO:
- check widths                                                          _*_ _*_

Input Registers:
- check widths                                                          _*_ _*_
- fp_a_reg samples fp_a_i @ clk_i                                       _*_ _*_
- fp_b_reg samples fp_b_i @ clk_i                                       _*_ _*_
- if rst_i is high, valid_reg samples 0       @ clk_i                   _*_ _*_
- if rst_i is low,  valid_reg samples valid_i @ clk_i                   _*_ _*_

Main:
- check widths                                                          _*_ _*_
- sign, exp and frac_ex starting values                                 _*_ _*_

then

- the logic is as such:
    - with the context of the previous round (rnv)                      _*_ _*_
    - carry bit is 0                                                    _*_ _*_
    - lead bit is either 1 or 0                                         _*_ _*_
    - if the sign bits are the same, then we can maintain               _*_ _*_
      both frac ex as they are
    - if the sign bits differ, then the negative sign one needs         _*_ _*_
      to be converted by performing complement + 1
    - the idea here is adding the frac ex directly is fine              _*_ _*_
      when the signs are the same (it's just magnitudes). If they
      differ, one being converted will guarantee that when they are
      added together, than an overflow will not occur since we
      are adding a positive and negative value together.
    - We can then use the sign bits to determine later whether          _*_ _*_
      the carry bit should be interpreted as an actual carry bit
      or sign bit (as will be written in the avt_verify.txt file)
    - ~ is fine                                                         _*_ _*_
    - + 1 is fine                                                       _*_ _*_
    - != is fine                                                        _*_ _*_
 
Output:
- fp_*_o is the concatenation of fp_*_sign, fp_*_exp and fp_*_frac_ex   _*_ _*_
- valid_o is valid_reg                                                  _*_ _*_
